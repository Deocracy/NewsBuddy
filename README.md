# NewsBuddy

_making a future where society is democratized, open, & secure_

## Overview

NewsBuddy's purpose is to provide all news to a user with algorithms that are created democratically to sort through and understand what is important in the news. NewsBuddy scrapes all of the world's news and stores it in a decentralized database. AI, which has a chat function in addition to its sorting function, is democratically processed to bring to light what is relevant. Plug-ins will fill out each feature and tool that is relevant to the user as the entire system is made to be modular in both its UX and functionality. NewsBuddy is a Dapp with everyone operating at Layer-1 as the hardware requirements are small; check out [DeCDN](https://github.com/Deocracy/DeCDN) for this framework.

## Background

Thoughts behind making NewsBuddy.
It is impossible to find all news in one place. Not just the current news but all past news as well. Moreover, there’s nothing useful we could do with all this information even if we had access to it.
What we want is a meaningful way to address all this news that will produce relevant information to myself as an individual; which may be different from other individuals.
In addition to this we are going to need a way of trusting this archive of news, part of which is having it be censorship-resistant and operated democratically.
There are many different ways news is censored; from bombarding the user with too much news so that the meaningful news is drowned out, to outright blocking news stories.
It is our hope that news can be made trustworthy through proofs and not blind faith alone.
